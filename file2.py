# 1) Create a Python file named lab_2-2.py

# 2) Set a equal to 3 and b equal to a
a = 3
b = a
# 3) Print the value of b and the value of a.
print (a,b)
# 4) What is the value of each variable and why? (Answer as a comment)
#a and b are equal to 3 becuse we first set a equal to 3 and then set b equal to a makeing them both the same.
# 5) Set a equal to 7.
a = 7
# 6) Print the value of a and the value of b
print (a,b)
# 7) What is the value of each variable and why? (Answer as a comment)
#a is 7 and b is 3 becuse we first set a equal to 3 and then set b equal to a makeing b 3 then we redefine a as 7 not affecting b.
